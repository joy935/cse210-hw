To-do list program
Task management program to create and manage a list of tasks 

This task management program allows the user to create and manage a list of tasks to do to be organized and productive. The program enables the user to easily create, visualize and complete the tasks based on certain preferences.

The To-Do program includes the following key features: 
1)	Create new tasks. The user has the choice of creating three different types of tasks: 
    - a simple task : the user precises only the description of the task
    - a scheduled task : the user sets the description of the task and its due date 
    - a repetitive task :  similar to a schedule task, this type of task allows the user to repeat this task for a number of time and its frequency
2)	List the tasks. The program sorts the tasks by their due date to orient the focus on the most urgent matters. The repetitive task will be displayed one at a time to prevent overwhelming the user. Also, the overdue tasks will be distinctly highlighted to ensure no critical deadlines are overlooked. Finally, the program displays the accomplished tasks to allow the user a complete vizualisation. 
3)	Complete the tasks. When the user completes a task, it gets removed from the to-do list. For a repetitive task, the program reintroduces them one at a time until the specified number of repetition is reached to maintain a manageable workload for the user with an updated due date. Additionaly, the program is designed to display all of the tasks before prompting the user which one has been completed. A checkmark will be displayed on the already accomplished task so the user can focus on those in progress.

Ideas on features to include in the future:
- Allow the user to convert a type of task to another. For instance, convert a simple task to a scheduled task by adding a due date.
- Add more variety to the repetitive tasks. For instance, a "forever" repetition, set the end of the repetition as a date (instead of setting a number of repetition) and add a bi-weekly frequency.
